# Regularisation Code Implementations

This notebook is meant as an additional resource to the blog it is linked to. You can refer to my blog on regularisation on [Medium](https://medium.com/p/5cbd2932612d/edit).

This project demonstrates various regularisation techniques to control overfitting in machine learning and deep learning models. It includes code examples using `scikit-learn`, `PyTorch`, `NumPy`, and visual demonstrations with `matplotlib` and `PIL`. 

## Topics Covered
- Penalty-Based Regulatisation Techniques
  - L2 (Ridge) 
  - L1 (Lasso) 
  - ElasticNet 
- Training Process-Based Regulatisation Techniques
  - Dropout
  - Early Stopping
  - Max Norm 
- Data-Based Regulatisation Techniques
  - SMOTE
  - Mixup
  - Cutout
  - CutMix
  - Noise Injection

## Requirements

Install dependencies with:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Images

Images such as cat.jpg, dog.jpg, bagel.jpg, and croissant.jpg are used for demonstration. Ensure they are saved locally in the same directory.
